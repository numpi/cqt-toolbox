%% Solving Jackson waiting Queues.

%% Generating the problem
%
% We use the function CQTGALLERY to construct the problems from the paper
% of Motyer and Taylor [1]. In this case we choose the example with index
% equal to 2.  We also start a timer using the function TIC, so we will
% measure how long it takes to solve the entire problem. 

[Am1, A0, A1, hA0] = cqtgallery('jackson', 2);

%%
% We will need a certain threshold to regulate the truncation of the
% output, which can be set here.

threshold = 1e-12;

%%
% We solve the associated matrix equations $A_{-1} + A_0 G + A_1 G^2 = 0$
% and $R^2  A_{-1} + R A_0 + A_1 = 0$ by means of cyclic reduction.

[G, R] = cr(Am1, A0, A1, 12);

% Let's double check if these are the correct solutions
fprintf('Residue of the right solution G: %1.2e\n', ...
    norm(Am1 + A0 * G + A1* G^2));
fprintf('Residue of the left solution R: %1.2e\n', ...
    norm(R^2 * Am1 + R * A0 + A1));

%%
% We can now compute the matrix $M = A_0 + A_1 G$ so that it is block
% tridiagonal and block Toeplitz, with at most the top-left block different
% from the other diagonal ones. We need to find an integer $m$ such that
% the correction is contained in the first $m$ rows and columns, and such
% that the numerical band of $M$ is less than $m$.

M = hA0 + A1 * G;
[Mm, Mp] = symbol(M);

m = max([ size(correction(M)), length(Mm), length(Mp) ]);

% Construct the blocks $\hat M_0, M_{-1}, M_0, M_1$ so that

% $$ M = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc} \hat M_0 & M_1 && \\ M_{-1} & M_0 & M_1

% want to increase m).

%%
% We can now compute the other rows of the vector $\pi$ by multiplying
% $\pi_0$ on the right by the matrix $R$. Notice that these are all
% infinite vectors, therefore we will need to store them truncated in the
% output.
